### Abstract
Aspect plays a critical role in shaping the ecological profile in regions of steep terrain. The study area is in the Colorado Front Range, a dynamic ecosystem with diverse ecological zones across its many elevational ranges. This study sought to identify the effects of aspect, the downhill direction of a slope, on the abundance, distribution, and diversity of trees in the Cal-Wood region of the Front Range 879 trees were analyzed across 879 systematically randomized study zones, each with a radius of 25 meters. 10 of these zones were on north-facing slopes, and 10 of them were on south-facing slopes. The coordinates for these zones were randomly generated in ArcGIS Pro. The results of the study showed that trees are far more abundant on north-facing slopes than they are on south-facing slopes, and that north-facing slopes host a greater diversity of tree species than south-facing slopes. It was found that Douglas fir constitute the majority of trees on north-facing slopes, while Ponderosa pine dominate on south-facing slopes. The data revealed that the aspects of Ponderosa pine exhibit a roughly uniform distribution, while Douglas fir are highly concentrated along north-facing slopes. The ecological patterns found in this study could apply to forest and wildfire management, especially in light of the 2020 Cal-Wood Wildfire.
